I am not sure how to create issue with BitBucket and this is easy enough.

- Add more debug information
- Update the compiler to the latest version.  You cannot compile a *.p4 file and get the graphs currently.
- In P4_HLIR, need to add checks for if fields exist or not
- In P4_Graphs, need to add a function that prints graphs for visualization / debug
